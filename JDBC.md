# What is JDBC ?
- It is standard Java Api.
- It is used when we want to connect a Java Application with a Database.
- It is a part of Java Standard Edition.
    - Java comes in 3 different editions : 
        1. **Java Standard Edition**: It contains core Java and JDBC. 
        2. **Java Enterprise Edition**: It contains JSPs and servlets.
        3. **Java Micor Edition**: Used for mobile application development. 
- It is database independent i.e we can use same piece of code to connect with Oracle DB, Sql or anything else.

# Components of JDBC
1. **Driver Software** : Translate Java Application query into a format that the database understands and converts the database responses back into Java-readable format. 
2. **Connection** :  Establishes a link between the Java application and the database, allowing communication between them.
3. **Statement Object** : It takes Java Application query to the DB and bring back the response generated by the DB.
4. **Result Set** : The response that DB sent back to the Java Application is present inside the ResultSet.


# JDBC Architecture

- Java Application communicates with Driver Manager which is provided by the JDBC Api. 
- Location of JDBC Api: `java.sql` and `javax.sql` package.
- Features of Driver Manger : 
    - It manages all the driver software.
    - It is responsible for register and unregister driver software.
    - It is responsible for establishing the connection between database and java application.

- JDBC Api provides classes and interfaces which developers and driver software vendors can use.  
- Implementation of Interface present inside the JDBC Api is provided by the driver software vendor. The implemented classes are called as Driver Software. 
- Driver Software are present in the form of JAR files. It can be provided by either Java or Database Vendor or some third party.

# Types of JDBC Driver
1. Type-1 also known as bridge drivers.
2. Type-2 also known as native drivers.
3. Type-3 also known as middleware drivers.
4. Type-4 alos known as pure java drivers or thin drivers.

# Type-1 Driver

- As we can observe from the above figure Type-1 driver is not directly communicating with the Database instead it is communicating with the ODBC driver. 
- Features of Type-1 driver :
    - We don't need to install this driver separately as it comes with JDK itself.
    - This driver is Database independent because ODBC driver is the one who's communicating with the Database not the Type-1 driver.
- Limitations of Type-1 driver :
    - It is slowest driver becuase it requires multiple conversion. i.e `JavaApplication ----> Type1Conversion ----> ODBC Conversion ----> DB Conversion`.
    - Internally, the Type-1 driver uses ODBC, which is only compatible with Windows machines. Therefore, Type-1 drivers can only be used on Windows, making them platform-dependent.
    - Not supported by modern java.

# Type-2 Driver
